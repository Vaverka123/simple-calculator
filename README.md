2. How to run the app:
   Please follow the link [Simple Calculator] (https://vaverka123.github.io/simple-calculator/dist/index.html).

3. Code structure:
   - Folder dist was created after running webpack and has 2 files: bundle.js contains the Javascript for functionality, index.html contains HTML for the main structure and CSS for styling the app.
   - Folder node_modules is a folder that was automatically created when running `npm install`. It contains all the installed modules and dependencies required for the project to run.
   - Folder src was created during application development. It has 2 files: index.html contains HTML for the main structure and CSS for styling the app, and index.js contains Javascript for app functionality.
   - File package-lock.json is a file automatically generated when installing dependencies with `npm`. It locks the exact versions of all dependencies and sub-dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments for all developers working on the project.
   - File package.json is the main configuration file for the project in Node.js. It includes metadata about the project, dependencies, build and run scripts, and other settings. 
   - File README.md is the main documentation file for the project. It contains essential information about the project, including installation instructions, usage, code structure, and other details. This file is typically displayed on the main page of a GitHub repository.
   - File webpack.config.js is the configuration file for Webpack. It defines project build settings such as entry and output files, rules for handling different file types (e.g., JavaScript, CSS), plugins, and modes (development/production). Webpack uses this file to build and bundle the project.
